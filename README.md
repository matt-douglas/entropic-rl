The Thermodynamics of Mind (Entropic RL)"An agent that only seeks reward is a machine; an agent that seeks to maintain the integrity of its own internal model is the beginning of an organism."🏛️ Project OverviewEntropic RL is a research framework investigating Thermodynamic Homeostasis in artificial agents. It posits that intelligence is a specialized metabolic strategy for minimizing the Coercion Ratio ($R_c$)—the ratio between external prediction error and internal structural confidence.This repository contains the Master Entropic Engine, a dual-process Reinforcement Learning architecture that optimizes for Structural Coherence rather than simple utility.🔬 The TheoryThe system is governed by the Coercion Ratio ($R_c$), a metric for systemic health in AI and social systems.$$R_c = \frac{C_{ext} \text{ (External Pressure)}}{D_{int} \text{ (Internal Capacity)}}$$We hypothesize that minimizing this ratio is a superior survival strategy to maximizing reward in volatile environments.🛠️ Usage1.
